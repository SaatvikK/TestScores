Year 12 October 2020 – Computer Science A Level

A teacher needs a program to record marks for a class of 30 students who have sat three computer science tests.

Write and test a program for the teacher.
• Your program must include appropriate prompts for the entry of data.
• Error messages and other output need to be set out clearly and understandably.
• All variables, constants and other identifiers must have meaningful names.
You will need to complete these three tasks. Each task must be fully tested.

TASK 1 – Set up arrays

Set-up one dimensional arrays to store:
• Student names
• Student marks for Test 1, Test 2 and Test 3
	Test 1 is out of 20 marks
	Test 2 is out of 25 marks
	Test 3 is out of 35 marks
• Total score for each student
Input and store the names for 30 students. You may assume that the students’ names are unique.
Input and store the students’ marks for Test 1, Test 2 and Test 3. All the marks must be validated on
entry and any invalid marks rejected.
TASK 2 – Calculate

Calculate the total score for each student and store in the array.
Calculate the average total score for the whole class.
Output each student’s name followed by their total score.
Output the average total score for the class.
TASK 3 – Select
Select the student with the highest total score and output their name and total score.
